    "London has the highest number of cafe in the city. It would be recommended to visit London to have greatest access to most number of cafe in the country. However, cafe location in Cambridge appears to be denser than the other cities. Albeit the lowest number of cafe, Cambridge is highly recommended for tourists who have limited amount of time to explore cafe in a city due to the highly densed location of cafe in the city (practically speaking, it is impossible to visit hundreds of cafe in a single trip). Tourists are recommended to book accomdation around 'Parker's piece' in Camrbidge as this location is the mean coordinate of all cafe locations. "
